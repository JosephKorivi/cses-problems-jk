# CSES Problem Set Solutions - Java

Welcome to my **CSES Problem Set Solutions** repository! 🚀 This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the **CSES Problem Set**, solved efficiently using **Java** with optimized approaches to suit the CSES system constraints.

## 📌 About
I am **Joseph Korivi**, a passionate problem solver who enjoys tackling algorithmic challenges using Java. My goal is to provide clean, well-structured, and optimized solutions that can help others understand and learn from my approach.

## 🛠️ Features
- 📝 **Optimized Solutions**: Each solution is carefully designed to meet CSES system constraints.
- 🚀 **Efficient Algorithms**: Focused on time and space complexity optimizations.
- 📖 **Readable Code**: Well-commented and structured solutions for easy understanding.
- ✅ **Accepted Submissions**: All solutions are tested and accepted by the CSES system.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The problems are categorized based on their respective sections in the CSES Problem Set:
```
📁 cses-java-solutions/
   ├── Introductory Problems/
   ├── Sorting and Searching/
   ├── Dynamic Programming/
   ├── Graph Algorithms/
   ├── Tree Algorithms/
   ├── Mathematics/
   ├── Range Queries/
   ├── Strings/
   ├── Geometry/
   ├── Advanced Techniques/
   ├── Additional Problems/
```
Each folder contains Java solution files named after the respective problem.
